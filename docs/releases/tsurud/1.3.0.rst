tsurud 1.3.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.3.0!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-1.3.0>`, :ref:`bug fixes
<bug-1.3.0>` and :ref:`required migrations <migrations-1.3.0>`.

.. _new-1.3.0:

New features
============

Routers configurable by app (`#1492 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1492>`_)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release of tsuru removes the relationship between plans and routers. Routers
need to be set directly to the app (a default one will be used if none is set).

Having routers tied to plans had an unpleasant experience for users that wanted
to have multiple resource plans(N) and also had more than one available router(M).
This required users to set up N*M plans.

Generic Pool Constraints (`#1528 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1528>`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before this release, one could limit a pool to a set of specific teams. This release
makes it possible to also constraint specific routers to specific pools and makes it
easy to add new types of constraints in the future.

Blockable Events (`#1502 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1502>`_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since tsuru 1.1, every action performed on tsuru API, e.g deploys, generates an event.
This release of tsuru adds the capability of blocking certain actions from being performed.
This can be used in a variety of ways, e.g, blocking every action during a maintenance, blocking
all actions from a certain user to mitigate a security issue etc.

Other improvements
------------------

* Support limiting the number of concurrent node-container actions
  `#1513 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1513>`_
* Addition of several metrics about downstream services consumed by tsuru
  `#1535 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1535>`_

.. _migrations-1.3.0:

Required migrations
===================

* Due to the removal of the relationship between routers and plans, a migration is required.
  This migration will set the router directly to each app based on it's plan (falling back to the default router if none is set).
  Just run ``tsurud migrate`` after updating tsuru.

* Due to the newly created pool constraints, a migration is required to make current pool teams
  work as expected. This migration will create the corresponding constraint for each pool.
  Just run ``tsurud migrate`` after updating tsuru.

.. _bug-1.3.0:

Bug fixes
=========

* Do not ignore memory limits when auto scale is disabled for the pool
  `#1420 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1420>`_
