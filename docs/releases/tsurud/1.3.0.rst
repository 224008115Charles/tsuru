tsurud 1.3.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.3.0!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-1.3.0>`, :ref:`bug fixes
<bug-1.3.0>` and :ref:`required migrations <migrations-1.3.0>`.

.. _new-1.3.0:

New features
============

Routers configurable by app (`#1492 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1492>`_)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release of tsuru removes the relationship between plans and routers. Routers
need to be set directly to the app (a default one will be used if none is set).

Having routers tied to plans had an unpleasant experience for users that wanted
to have multiple resource plans(N) and also had more than one available router(M).
This required users to set up N*M plans.

Other improvements
------------------

* Support limiting the number of concurrent node-container actions
  `#1513 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1513>`_
* Addition of several metrics about downstream services consumed by tsuru
  `#1535 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1535>`_

.. _migrations-1.3.0:

Required migrations
===================

* Due to the removal of the relationship between routers and plans, a migration is required.
  This migration will set the router directly to each app based on it's plan (falling back to the default router if none is set).
  Just run ``tsurud migrate`` after updating tsuru.

.. _bug-1.3.0:

Bug fixes
=========

* Do not ignore memory limits when auto scale is disabled for the pool
  `#1420 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1420>`_
